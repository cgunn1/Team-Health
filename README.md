# Team-Health
Final Thesis Project


Welcome to the Team Health application! Team Health is a mobile application that
allows you and your friends to hold each other accountable while achieving your goals.
At this current stage in the design phase, this application is best viewed on the Google
Chrome web browser. A mobile device using iOS 10 or higher is not required, but it is
preferred. If you would like to view this website on a desktop or laptop, resizing the
internet browserâ€™s window to a smaller screen size is optimal. MacOSX or higher is not
required, but it is preferred.
